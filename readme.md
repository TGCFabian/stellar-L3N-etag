### Flash into the firmware steps
- 1. Remove the battery cover and observe whether the motherboard is as shown in the figure below. (Or check whether the master control is TLSR8359)

- 2. Solder GND, VCC, RX, RTS four wires.
- 3. Use the usb2ttl module (CH340) to link the four soldered wires. Where rx is connected to tx, tx is connected to rx, vcc is connected to 3.3v, and GND is connected to GND. The RTS flying wire is connected to the third pin of the chip CH340G (you can also not solder it, manually connect it to GND before programming).
- 4. Open https://atc1441.github.io/ATC_TLSR_Paper_UART_Flasher.html, the default baud rate is 460800, Atime is the default, and the file is Firmware/ATC_Paper.bin
- 5. Click unlock first, then click write to flush, and wait for completion. On success, the screen will refresh automatically.

### Project compilation

```cmd

     cd Firmware
     makeit.exe clean && makeit.exe -j12

```

Prompt content after success:

```
'Create Flash image (binary format)'

### Bluetooth link and OTA update
- 1. The TTL TX line must be disconnected first, otherwise the Bluetooth connection will not work.
- 2. OTA upgrade: https://atc1441.github.io/ATC_TLSR_Paper_OTA_writing.html

### upload image
- 1. Run `cd web_tools && python -m http.server`
- 2. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 and link Bluetooth on the page
- 3. Select a picture and upload it. After uploading, you can add text or draw text manually. The dithering algorithm can also be set.
- 4. Send to the device, wait for the screen to refresh
